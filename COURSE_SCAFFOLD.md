## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Guidelines for LLM

### Code Snippet Requirements

1. **Visual-First Comments**: Focus on what students will SEE change
2. **Simple Language**: Use beginner-friendly explanations
3. **Immediate Feedback**: Every change should be visually obvious
4. **Side-by-Side Examples**: Show traditional vs modern approaches
5. **Single-File Examples**: Keep everything in one file when possible

### Comment Structure Template

```html
<!-- This creates a blue button that changes color when clicked -->
<button
	onclick="changeColor()"
	style="background-color: blue; color: white; padding: 10px; border: none; border-radius: 5px;">
	Click me to change color!
</button>

<!-- Input field with proper contrast for visibility -->
<input
	type="text"
	placeholder="Type here..."
	style="background-color: white; color: black; border: 2px solid #ccc; padding: 8px; margin: 10px;" />

<script>
	// This function changes the button color to red
	function changeColor() {
		// Find the button and change its background color
		document.querySelector("button").style.backgroundColor = "red";
	}
</script>
```

### Interactive Exercise Format

Each exercise should include:

1. **What You'll See**: Visual description of the change
2. **What to Change**: Specific line to modify
3. **Expected Result**: What should happen visually
4. **Try This**: Additional modifications to experiment with

### File Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive names that indicate the visual outcome
- Include `-demo` or `-comparison` in filenames
- Keep files self-contained when possible

### README Structure for Each Module

```markdown
# Module Name (X minutes)

## What You'll Learn

- See how [concept] works visually
- Understand the difference between [approach A] and [approach B]

## Quick Start

1. Open the HTML file in your browser
2. Follow the numbered comments in the code
3. Make changes and refresh to see results

## Files

- `demo.html` - Interactive example with comments
- `comparison.html` - Side-by-side traditional vs modern

## Try This

1. Change [specific value] to [new value] and see [visual result]
2. Modify [element] to [new element] and notice [change]
3. Add [property] and watch [visual effect]
```

## üé® Design Principles

### Visual-First Approach

- Every example shows immediate visual changes
- Use bright colors and obvious styling differences
- Include before/after comparisons
- Focus on what students can SEE, not just read
- **Always ensure proper contrast**: White backgrounds with black text for inputs
- **Avoid dark-on-dark styling**: Use contrasting colors for readability

### Direct Comparisons

- Side-by-side traditional vs modern code
- Same functionality built both ways
- Clear visual indicators of which approach is which
- Toggle between versions to see differences

### Rapid Feedback

- Single-file examples that work immediately
- No complex setup or build processes
- Changes visible with simple browser refresh
- Clear instructions for what to modify

## üöÄ Quick Setup Guide

### What Students Need

- Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- A simple text editor (VS Code, Sublime, or even Notepad)
- No additional software installation required

### File Structure

- Keep everything in single HTML files when possible
- Use inline CSS and JavaScript for simplicity
- Include all code in one file for easy editing

## üìö Key Learning Outcomes

After completing this 2-hour course, students will:

1. **Understand Visual Web Development**: See how code creates visual elements
2. **Compare Approaches**: Know the difference between traditional and modern methods
3. **Make Immediate Changes**: Confidently modify code and see results
4. **Recognize Patterns**: Understand how functions control page behavior
5. **See the Evolution**: Appreciate why modern frameworks exist

## üé® Styling Guidelines for Input Elements

### Traditional CSS Approach

```css
/* Always use high contrast for input fields */
input[type="text"],
textarea {
	background-color: white;
	color: black;
	border: 2px solid #ccc;
	padding: 8px;
	font-size: 16px;
}

/* Focus states for better UX */
input[type="text"]:focus,
textarea:focus {
	border-color: #007bff;
	outline: none;
	box-shadow: 0 0 5px rgba(0, 123, 255, 0.3);
}
```

### Tailwind CSS Approach

```html
<!-- High contrast input with Tailwind classes -->
<input
	type="text"
	class="bg-white text-black border-2 border-gray-300 p-2 text-base focus:border-blue-500 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-200"
	placeholder="Type here..." />
```
